## iCloud Private Relay Experiments

This repository contains the dataset and the code used for the paper: *"Measuring the Performance of iCloud Private Relay"*, Martino Trevisan, Idilio Drago, Paul Schmitt, Francesco Bronzino, to appear in **PAM 2023**.


### Dataset

In the `data` folder, there are the datasets we collected for the paper, that were used to create the figures and draw conclusions. They are in plain `CSV` format and can be read with any tool, including Python Pandas.

### Prerequisites

The provided scripts visit a set of **websites** with and without the iCloud Private Relay. It drives Safari using BrowserTime and collects various metrics from the **visits**. Tested on Mac OS Monterrey 12.3.1 (21E258). The `curl` folder contains a simple script to record the time of **bulk HTTP downloads**. For the **Ookla speed test experiments**, we used the [PySpeedTest](https://github.com/marty90/pyspeedtest) Python library. 

You need:
* A MacOS PC with OS version Monterrey
* An iCloud+ subscription
* BrowserTime installed. Install it in this project directory with `npm install browsertime`.
* `httpstat` installed (even if not mandatory). Install it with `brew`.
* You must enable the 'Allow Remote Automation' option in Safari's Develop menu in order to control Safari via WebDriver.
* Notice that the `SpeedIndex` feature may be wrongly use python2 while it needs python3. The `python` command should point to 'python3'. I made `ln -s ../Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python`.
* You need `ffmpeg` for the SpeedInex and ImageMagic for processing it (install with `brew install imagemagick`)

### How to run these experiments

You have to run the `1_visit.sh` script. The script visits the websites and store the results in the `results-pr` and `results-no-pr` directories.

* You may need to customize the strings in `activate-private-relay.scpt` and `deactivate-private-relay.scpt` to you system language. Test them to see if they activate/deactivate the Private Relay correctly.
* Also check in the above script the `PRIVACY_RELAY_INDEX`. It must match the Private Relay position in the System Preference -> Apple ID menu. Count starts from 1.
* Customize the variable `WEBSITE_LIST` to point to the desired website list. We have top 100 for Italy, France and US, according to SimilarWeb.
* Set the correct interface for `tcpdump` in the variable `IFACE`
* You can customize with `NUM` and `HEAD` the repetitions for each website and to possibly shorten the list, respectively.
